<h3>About me</h3>

<h3>Code examples</h3>
<br>It is a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY). The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'. The conversion rate is 6.75 CNY for every 1 USD. All numbers are represented as a string with 2 decimal places.</br>

<br>function usdcny(usd) {</br>
<br>return (usd*6.75).toFixed(2) + ' Chinese Yuan';</br>
<br>}</br>
