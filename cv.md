### About me
For now, I do want to learn something I can use as a Front-end developer in the future. My skills are quite poor to be a professional developer so I've decided to try any courses to become a better specialist. For the last 2 months, awaiting for the courses, I was self-studying and got some basics skills to be ready for RS school course.
### Skills 
* HTML and CSS
* Git, GitHub
* Node.js (basically)
* C++ (basically)
* Java (basically)
* VS Code
* IntelliJ IDEA
### Code examples
It is a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY). The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'. The conversion rate is 6.75 CNY for every 1 USD. All numbers are represented as a string with 2 decimal places.
```
function usdcny(usd) {
  return (usd*6.75).toFixed(2) + ' Chinese Yuan';
}
```
